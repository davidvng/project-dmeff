srun: error: d0049: task 1: Out Of Memory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An MPI communication peer process has unexpectedly disconnected.  This
usually indicates a failure in the peer process (e.g., a crash or
otherwise exiting without calling MPI_FINALIZE first).

Although this local MPI process will likely now behave unpredictably
(it may even hang or crash), the root cause of this problem is the
failure of the peer -- that is what you need to investigate.  For
example, there may be a core file that you can examine.  More
generally: such peer hangups are frequently caused by application bugs
or other external events.
